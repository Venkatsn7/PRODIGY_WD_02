Stopwatch Web Application - Web Development Internship Task 2

Task Description:
As part of my internship at PRODIGY Infotech, I was assigned the task of creating a Stopwatch Web Application. This application is designed to be interactive and user-friendly, allowing users to:

- Accurately measure and record time intervals.

Features:
- Start/Stop Functionality: Users can start or pause the stopwatch with a single click.
- Reset Stopwatch: Reset the stopwatch back to 0 for a fresh start.
- Lap Time Tracking: Users can record lap times and view them separately.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to work smoothly across various screen sizes.
